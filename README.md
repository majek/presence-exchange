# RabbitMQ "Presence Exchange" Plugin

Extends RabbitMQ Server with support for a new experimental exchange
type, `x-presence`. An exchange of type `x-presence` notifies queues
that are bound to it when other bindings appear and disappear.

Messages are only ever sent out from an `x-presence` exchange to
attached queues when a new binding appears or an existing binding
disappears. The message sent out has an empty body, with all the
interesting information in the `headers` property of the message
headers:

    Key       Type  Description
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    action    str   Either "bind" or "unbind"
    exchange  str   The name of the exchange being bound/unbound
    queue     str   The name of the queue being bound/unbound
    key	      str   The binding key supplied at the time of binding

Messages published to `x-presence` exchanges are sent to all the
bound queues - just like in a fanout exchange.
